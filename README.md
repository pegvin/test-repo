**NOTE**: after forking the repository, please make it private because anybody can download your generated build which is a direct violation of the EULA.

if this really helped you, please join aseprite's discord server and thank them for this masterpiece, and if possible buy it in future.

## Why?

well building aseprite is very painful, it's more than 3k files that are compiled and on a old laptop good luck compiling it, for me i want to keep my windows installation clean installing visual studio tools and stuff is pain for me as i use msys2 for compilation on windows, so this simple guide provides how to compile aseprite from source without actually downloading any tools.

## What About EULA?

well EULA does allow us to compile the source, it just doesn't allow us to distribute the final built app.
